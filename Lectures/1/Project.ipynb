    "Load the image dog.jpg and compute the economy SVD. Compute the relative reconstruction error of the truncated SVD in the Frobenius norm as a function of the rank r. Square this error to compute the fraction of missing variance as a function of r. You may also decide to plot 1 minus the error or missing variance to visualize the amount of norm or variance captured at a given rank r. Plot these quantities along with the cumulative sum of singular values as a function of r. Find the rank r where the reconstruction captures 99% of the total variance. Compare this with the rank r where the reconstruction captures 99% in the Frobenius norm and with the rank r that captures 99% of the cumulative sum of singular values."
